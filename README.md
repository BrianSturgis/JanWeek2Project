## Detailed Description
IN ITS CURRENT STATE THIS SOFTWARE IS MISSING SOME DEFINITION CONTENT AND IS %90 complete
This is a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. 
It is a solo project for a coding bootcamp i am attending in early 2021

## The projects objectives were to complete the following (MVP)
- Site uses branching to return the result.
- jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)
- Form gathers input from the user.
- Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
- Web page is styled using custom CSS.
