## Detailed Description
This is a Programming Language Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future students a series of questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers. You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant. 

## The projects objectives were to complete the following 
- Site uses branching to return the result.
- jQuery is used to show and hide the result after questions are answered and submitted. (Tip: test your app several times with different answers.)
- Form gathers input from the user.
- Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
- Web page is styled using custom CSS.
